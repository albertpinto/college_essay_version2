**Rika Pinto: A Visionary Entrepreneur with a Heart for Change**

Growing up in the vibrant and diverse community of Pleasanton, California, I found my calling at the intersection of creativity and commerce. This unique blend has defined my journey and continues to inspire my vision as a leader in business. As the founder and CEO of Romikas, a thriving jewelry enterprise, I embraced entrepreneurship at a young age, transforming my passion for design and marketing into a six-figure business with a social mission at its core.

In 2020, while many of my peers were navigating the early stages of adulthood, I launched Romikas, driven by a desire to create not just unique jewelry, but also meaningful change. Overseeing a team of 215 dedicated employees across the United States and India, I've realized the profound power of professional relationships and cultural exchanges. Each piece of jewelry tells its own story—an embodiment of my commitment to blending creativity with business acumen. This narrative is shared with over 5,000 customers, each interaction reinforcing the bond of community and trust we’ve built.

My experience extends beyond the creativity of design to the precision of analytics. During my time as a research intern with Support Vectors, I harnessed the capabilities of machine learning to understand consumer behaviors better. These insights equipped me to implement data-driven strategies at Romikas, optimizing our sales forecasts and enhancing inventory management. My ongoing research seeks to understand the broader economic impacts of seasonal sales fluctuations, which I intend to share through a forthcoming publication in the CODATA Science Journal.

My guiding principle is to infuse purpose into every aspect of my business career, a principle evident in my dedication to philanthropy and social advocacy. By donating up to 50% of Romikas's sales to organizations like Give India and the Trevor Project, I strive to make a tangible impact on causes close to my heart. This commitment is mirrored in my role with Asha for Education, where I leverage my marketing expertise to amplify the voices of young girls pursuing education in rural India.

Looking forward, I aim to expand my horizons at the University of California, Berkeley, where I am pursuing a dual degree in Business Administration and Economics. Here, I engage with like-minded individuals in Nova Consulting, embarking on projects that refine my ability to turn data into dynamic business strategies. These experiences are complemented by my creative pursuits—writing music that has reached thousands and performing on significant stages, such as the Nobel Peace Prize concert.

Through my ventures and academic pursuits, I aspire to continue shaping a future where creativity and business intersect with empathy and innovation, ensuring that every endeavor contributes to a richer, more connected world.
