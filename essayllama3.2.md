As I reflect on my journey, I realize that each experience has shaped me into a well-rounded individual with diverse interests and skills. Growing up in a family that valued education, I pursued various hobbies to foster personal growth and development. My passion for music led me to become an accomplished singer-songwriter, actor, dancer, and pianist.

One of my most significant experiences was volunteering at the Valley Humane Society, where I gained hands-on experience in animal care and developed empathy for those in need. This experience not only honed my skills but also instilled a sense of social responsibility within me. My time as a strategy consultant at Nova Consulting has further refined my analytical mindset and encouraged me to approach challenges with a data-driven perspective.

Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently sought opportunities to excel and grow. As the Vice President of Nationally Ranked HS Show Choir, I successfully curated and executed strategic initiatives that expanded the choir's impact through performances and collaborations. This experience taught me the importance of collaboration, effective communication, and adaptability in leadership roles.

My involvement with Asha for Education has given me a deeper understanding of the global community and the importance of empowering young girls through education. As a marketing committee member, I have had the opportunity to generate engaging content, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and contribute to a mission that resonates deeply with my values.

As a singer-songwriter, I have written original music that has resonated with audiences worldwide. My song "The Table" received over 15,000 streams in less than a week, and I was honored to perform at the Young Artist Awards and feature in the Nobel Peace Prize show.

In addition to my creative pursuits, I possess a strong foundation in technical skills. I have worked extensively with Microsoft Office, Canva, Shopify, Scratch, Python, Numpy, Pandas, and other tools to develop my expertise in data analysis, website building, and programming.

Throughout my journey, I have come to realize that each experience has contributed to the development of a well-rounded individual who is passionate about making a positive impact. I am excited to continue growing, learning, and applying my skills to drive meaningful change in various aspects of life.
