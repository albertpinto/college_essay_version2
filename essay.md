#EXTERNAL API DEFINITIONS

The following API definitions are for external providers that are used to generate the content or data that is stored in the "my-api-data" folder.

The API definition for the "my-api-data" folder is as follows:

```
// "my-api-data" is a folder that will be created in your project that will contain API definitions for external providers. You will need to add the API definition files for each provider you want to generate data from.
// For example, if you want to generate data from a database, you will need to add an API definition file in the "my-api-data" folder for that particular provider.
// Once added, the API definition will be automatically updated when the database is created and will be generated for each API call.

The API definition for each provider should be in the following format:

```
// The name of the API definition file should be "ProviderName.json".
// The name of the API definition folder should be "ProviderName".
// The provider name and API definitions should be in separate JSON files.
// The API name should be the name of the provider (e.g. "MyProvider").
// The provider name should be a sub-folder of the API name.
// The API name should be the name of the API folder.
// The API definitions should be in a separate folder with the name of the API.
// The API definition should include the URL or other data source for the API.
// The API key or secret data should be included in a separate JSON file within the API definition folder.
// The API key should be included in the authentication header of each API call.
// The API key should also be included in the API definition JSON file in the authentication header.
// The API key should be a string value.
// The data source should be a URL or a server that returns data in a specific format (e.g. JSON, XML).
// The JSON file should include the API definitions and data source information.
// The API definition should be included in a separate folder with the name of the API.
```

Make sure to add the API definition file to the project in the "my-api-data" folder.

The API definition for each provider should be added to the "my-api-data" folder and the API definition JSON files should be in the "ProviderName" folder.

The API endpoint URL for each provider should be included in the API definition JSON file with the corresponding authentication token and data source format.

For example, if you have a database named "mydb" and want to generate data from it, you would add an API definition in the "my-api-data" folder named "mydb.json" that includes the database URL and authentication token.

Once you've added the API definition, you can use the API endpoint URL to generate data from the database.

If you want to access the API endpoint URL from your server, you can use the HTTPS protocol to make the API call and authenticate using the API authentication token.

Note that you can change the authentication token format and the data source format by updating the JSON files in the "ProviderName" folder.
